### Review Questions

#### Project Summary

<b>Please summarize the project idea in your own words (3+ sentences).</b>
<h>Please read the report thoroughly. Your review can be rejected based on our assessment of the review quality. Each unsubmitted and rejected review will be penalized in your project evaluation.</h><br>


#### Report Evaluation

<b>[All] (Introduction) Are the motivation and problem statement clearly described?</b><br>
- Yes.
- No. (Please describe the details in the detailed comments.)


<b>[All] (Introduction) Are the implementation challenges (Development) or the technical contributions/novelties (Research) clearly described?</b><br>
- Yes.
- No. (Please describe the details in the detailed comments.)


<b>[Development] (Method Summary) Is the method summary clearly described (including input, desired output, supervision provided in the network training, representation of the data, etc)?</b><br>
- Yes.
- No. (Please describe the details in the detailed comments.)
- Research track.


<b>[Development] (Implementation Details) Are the implementation details clearly described (including the parts where the existing codes are used)?</b><br>
- Yes.
- No. (Please describe the details in the detailed comments.)
- Research track.


<b>[Research] (Related Work) Is the related work adequate, and Is relation to prior work well-explained? (If not, is there any missing prior work?)</b><br>
- Yes.
- No. (Please describe the details in the detailed comments.)
- Development track.


<b>[Research] (Method) Is the method clearly described (including input, desired output, supervision provided in the network training, representation of the data, main technical ideas, etc)?</b><br>
- Yes.
- No. (Please describe the details in the detailed comments.)
- Development track.


<b>[All] (Experimental Results) Are the experiment setups clearly described (including benchmark/dataset, evaluation metrics, baseline methods, quantitative/qualitative results, comparisons, failure cases)?</b><br>
- Yes.
- No. (Please describe the details in the detailed comments.)


<b> [All] (Acknowledgments) Are the 1) the role of each team member and 2) the external collaborators and their contributions clearly described?</b><br>
- Yes.
- No. (Please describe the details in the detailed comments.)


<b> [All] Overall, is the report well-organized and clearly written? If not, should there be additional explanations or illustrations?</b><br>
- Clear, only minor flaws. 
- Mostly clear, but improvements needed. (Please describe the details in the detailed comments.) 
- Difficult to understand in places. (Please describe the details in the detailed comments.) 
- Very hard to understand. (Please describe the details in the detailed comments.) 


#### Overall Evaluation

<b>[Development] (Degree of Challenges) How do you assess the difficulty of the implementation (when considering the number of team members, external collaborators, the parts where the submitters used the existing codes)?</b><br>
- Very hard, requires extraordinary efforts and/or skills.
- Challenging.
- Moderate. Doable.
- Easy.


<b>[Research] (Novelty) Does it present a new concept or idea?</b><br>
- Proposes novel and interesting views, ideas, or problems .
- Worthy contributions with some novel (but small) ideas. 
- Minor variations to existing techniques .
- Does not advance the state of knowledge , or closely duplicates existing work.


<b>[Research] (Technical quality) Is the approach technically sound?</b><br>
- Technically very strong and solid.
- Technically adequate.
- A few minor flaws.
- Claims not completely supported, assumptions or simplifications unrealistic, fatal mistakes.


<b>[All] (Experimental Results) Are the experiments well designed, sufficient, clearly described?</b><br>
- Extensive, detailed, and informative evaluations without any missing benchmark/dataset, evaluation metric, and comparison.
- Solid and sufficient to convince the merits of the proposed method (Research) or the performance of the implementation (Development) (although lacking some minor experiments or simplifying the experiment setup a bit.)
- Lacking some important experiments (in terms of benchmarks/datasets, evaluation metrics, comparisons, quantitative/qualitative results, etc).
- Insufficient, unfair, inadequate, or uninformative comparisons with related work  (Research) or the original work (Development).


<b>[Development] (Reproduction) Did the implementation reproduce the results in the original work?</b><br>
- Yes, and even improved/outperformed the original work, or showed more results in different applications.
- Almost, the results are similar.
- A bit worse but comparable.
- Significantly worse, or couldn’t reproduce the results at all.


<b>[All] (Strengths) Describe the strengths of the work in bullet points (with 2-3 bullets).</b><br>


<b>[All] (Weaknesses) Describe the weaknesses of the work in bullet points (with 2-3 bullets).</b><br>

<h>Please be constructive, respectful, and detailed in your comments.</h><br>


<b>[All] (Feedback) Provide questions or comments to the submitters if you have.</b><br>


<b>[All] (Overall Score) Please provide an "overall score" for this submission (in [1-5] range).</b><br>
<br>


#### Scoring Criteria

<h><b>Criteria of score 4 (‘Great!’) (AND conditions)</b></h>
- [All] <b>(Report Writing)</b> The report is well-organized and clearly written.
- [All] <b>(Experiment Designs)</b> The experiments are well-designed and convincing.
- [Development] <b>(Experimental Results)</b> Achieved similar results in a challenging development task with the original or improved/outperformed the original work in a doable task.
- [Research] <b>(Experimental Results)</b> Achieved promising results. Worth pursuing the direction for future paper publication (although not ready for now).
- [All] <b>(Etc)</b> No significant flaws in the report writing, experimental result demonstration, and poster presentation.

<h><b>Criteria of score 5 (‘Outstanding!’)</b></h>
- Better than ‘Great!’. Probably the best project in the class.

<h><b>Criteria of score 3 (‘Good!’)</b></h>
- Has one significant reason not to be ‘Great!’.

<h><b>Criteria of score 2 (‘Not Good’) (OR conditions)</b></h>
- Has two significant reasons not to be ‘Great!’.
- Shows poor experimenal designs or experimental results or technical contributions (while everything else is ok).

<h><b>Criteria of score 1 (‘Poor’) (OR conditions)</b></h>
- Has three or more significant reasons not to be ‘Great!’.
- Shows poor experimental designs or experimental results or technical contributions, and has one more significant reason not to be ‘Great!’.
