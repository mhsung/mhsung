### Presentation
- We'll have <em>two</em> presentations each day, and each presentation will be <em>20 mins</em> long.
- The presenter will ask at least <em>three</em> questions during the presentation.<br>
You'll need to answer them in the Slack <em>#lectures</em> channel (as we've done in previous lectures).
- Each presentation will be followed by a <em>7-10 min</em> group discussion.
- After the group discussion, the presenter will have <em>5 mins</em> to answer questions.
<br />

### Group Discussion
- One of the group members will be selected as a <em>group moderator.</em><br>
(Our TA will post the list of group moderators in the Slack <em>#paper-reviews</em> channel.)
- The <em>group moderator</em> is responsible for
    - leading the discussion,
    - writing <em>questions</em> in the Slack <em>#paper-reviews</em> channel, and
    - build a consensus of the presentation <em>evaluation</em>.
- After the group discussion, our TA will send a <em>direct message</em> to the <em>group moderators</em> in Slack and ask about the <em>peer evaluation result</em>.
<br />


### Peer Evaluaton
Please evaluate the presentation based on the following criteria:

- The presenter clearly delivered the problem statement and the key ideas.
- The presentation was well organized and prepared.
- The presenter was knowledgeable about the topic and any related issues.
- The presenter maintained my interest during the entire presentation.
- The visual aids were effective.

<em>DO NOT</em> evaluate based on
- speech skills (it’s not a speech course),
- technical issues of zoom, and
- whether the presenter used the author’s other’s slides.<br>
(Feel free to use slides on the Internet with reference.)

In each group, please write a <em>short comment</em> to the presenter and <em>choose one of the following:</em>
- <h>Probably the best presentation!</h>
- <h>It was clear and well organized.</h>
- <h>Good, but I couldn’t follow some.</h>
- <h>It could be better!</h>
- <h>Poor.</h>

<em>DO NOT write the evaluation resul in the public channel.</em><br>
Our TA will send a direct message to the <em>group moderators</em> in Slack and ask about the peer evaluation result.
<br />
